# Fixes
- Fixed lightbeams not being fogged.
- Fixed particles not being fogged.
- Fixed shields not being fogged.
- Fixed low-quality water not being fogged.
- Fixed the detail normal map in `normal_ext.detail` and `normal_ext.specular.detail` not being used.
- Fixed lights with projected textures not being handled correctly in `normal_ext.specular` and  `normal_ext.specular.detail`.

# Scary Changes
- Removed unused SWBF1 shaders `bump`, `detail`, `pervertexdiffuselighting`, `scroll`, `specmap`, 

# Issues
- Refraction projected texture uses linear_wrap_sampler.
- Projected cube textures are broken again.

# Work still to be done.
- sRGB to linear handling for vertex colors.
- get_material_color and get_static_diffuse_color refactors
- Lighting is a mess in `normal_ext`. Could also be imrpoved across the board similar to transform handling.
- Fixup water refraction condition handling in C++.
- Fix Gaussian Scene Blur and Damage Overlay being disabled.
